<p><i>Science fiction, in collaboration with the idea-men and technicians of Hollywood,
has been responsible for many horrors, dating back to &#8220;The Cabinet
of Dr. Caligari&#8221; and &#8220;The Lost World.&#8221; But Hollywood has created one
real-life horror that tops all creations of fantasy&mdash;the child star.
In this story we at last see such a brat meet Things from Alien Space.</i></p>

<h1>jimsy<br />
and<br />
the<br />
monsters</h1>
<p class='center larger'><b><i>by ... Walt Sheldon</i></b></p>
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mr. Maximilian Untz</span> regarded
the monsters with a critical
eye. Script girls, cameramen,
sometimes even stars quailed
under Mr. Untz&#8217;s critical eye&mdash;but
not these monsters. The first
had a globelike head and several
spidery legs. The second was
willowy and long-clawed. The
third was covered with hair. The
prop department had outdone
itself.</p>
<p class='sidebarright'>Hollywood could handle just about<br />
anything&mdash;until Mildume&#8217;s machine<br />
brought in two real aliens.</p>
<p>&#8220;Get Jimsy,&#8221; said Mr. Untz,
snapping his fingers.</p>
<p>A young earnest assistant producer
with a crew cut turned and
relayed the summons. &#8220;Jimsy&mdash;Jimsy
LaRoche!&#8221; Down the line
of cables and cameras it went.
<i>Jimsy</i> ... <i>Jimsy</i>....</p>
<p>A few moments later, from
behind the wall flat where he had
been playing canasta with the
electricians, emerged Jimsy LaRoche,
the eleven-year-old sensation.
He took his time. He wore
powder-blue slacks and a sports
shirt and his golden hair was carefully
ringleted. He was frowning.
He had been interrupted with a
meld of a hundred and twenty.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay, so what is it now?&#8221; he
said, coming up to Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>Mr. Untz turned and glared
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_50' name='page_50'></a>50</span>
down at the youth. Jimsy returned
the glare. There was a sort
of cold war between Mr. Untz
and Master Jimsy LaRoche, the
sort you could almost hear hotting
up. Mr. Untz pointed to the
monsters. &#8220;Look, Jimsy. Look
at them. What do you think?&#8221; He
watched the boy&#8217;s expression carefully.</p>
<p>Jimsy said, &#8220;To use one of your
own expressions, Max&mdash;<i>pfui</i>.
They wouldn&#8217;t scare a mouse.&#8221;
And then Jimsy shrugged and
walked away.</p>
<p>Mr. Untz turned to his assistant.
&#8220;Harold,&#8221; he said in an injured
tone. &#8220;You saw it. You heard it.
You see what I&#8217;ve got to put up
with.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure,&#8221; said Harold Potter
sympathetically. He had mixed
feelings toward Mr. Untz. He
admired the producer&#8217;s occasional
flashes of genius, he deplored his
more frequent flashes of stupidity.
On the whole, however, he regarded
himself as being on Mr.
Untz&#8217;s side in the war between
Mr. Untz and the world and
Hollywood. He knew Mr. Untz&#8217;s
main trouble.</p>
<p>Some years ago Maximilian
Untz had been brought to Hollywood
heralded as Vienna&#8217;s greatest
producer of musicals. So far
he had been assigned to westerns,
detectives, documentaries, a fantasy
of the future&mdash;but no
musicals. And now it was a psychological
thriller. Jimsy played
the killer as a boy and there was
to be a dream sequence, a nightmare
full of monsters. Mr. Untz
was determined it should be the
most terrifying dream sequence
ever filmed.</p>
<p>Only up to now he wasn&#8217;t
doing so good.</p>
<p>&#8220;I would give,&#8221; said Mr. Untz
to Harold Potter, &#8220;my right eye
for some <i>really</i> horrible monsters.&#8221;
He gestured at the world in
general. &#8220;Think of it, Harold.
We got atom bombs and B-29&#8217;s,
both vitamins and airplanes, and
stuff to cure you of everything
from broken legs to dropsy. A
whole world of modern science&mdash;but
nobody can make a fake
monster. It looks anything but
fake and wouldn&#8217;t scare an eleven-year-old
boy.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a thought,&#8221; agreed Harold
Potter. He had a feeling for things
scientific; he had taken a B.S. in
college but had drifted into
photography and thence into
movie production. He had a wife
and a spaniel and a collection of
pipes and a house in Santa
Monica with a workshop basement.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got to do some thinking,&#8221;
Mr. Untz said. &#8220;I believe I will
change my clothes and take a
shower. Come along to the cottage,
Harold.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay,&#8221; said Harold. He never
liked to say yes for fear of being
tagged a yes-man. Anyway, he
enjoyed relaxing in the office-cottage
while Mr. Untz showered
and changed, which Mr. Untz did
some three or four times a day.
When he got there Mr. Untz
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_51' name='page_51'></a>51</span>
disappeared into the dressing-room
and Harold picked up a
magazine.</p>
<p>There was a knock on the door.</p>
<p>Harold got up and crossed the
soft cream-colored carpet and
opened the door and saw a goat-like
person.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221; said Harold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Mildume,&#8221; said the goat-like
person. &#8220;Dr. John Mildume. Don&#8217;t
ask a lot of questions about how
I got in. Had a hard enough time
as it was. Fortunately I have
several relatives connected with
the studio. That&#8217;s how I heard of
your problem as a matter of fact.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;My problem?&#8221; said Harold.</p>
<p>Dr. Mildume pushed right in.
He was no more than five feet
five but had a normal sized head.
It was domelike. Wisps of tarnished
white hair curled about his
ears and crown. He had an out-thrust
underjaw with a small white
beard on its prow. He was dressed
in moderately shabby tweeds. He
moved across the room in an
energetic hopping walk and took
the place on the sofa Harold had
vacated.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now, then, Mr. Untz,&#8221; he
said, &#8220;the first thing we must do
is come to terms.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just a minute,&#8221; said Harold.
&#8220;I&#8217;m Mr. Untz&#8217;s assistant, Harold
Potter. Mr. Untz is in the shower.
Was he expecting you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Dr. Mildume blinked. &#8220;No,
not exactly. But he can&#8217;t afford
<i>not</i> to see me. I know all about
it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All about what?&#8221; asked Harold.</p>
<p>&#8220;The beasts,&#8221; the doctor said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The <i>which</i>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beasts, Potter,&#8221; snapped the
goat-like man. &#8220;The nightmare
monsters. Get with it, lad. And
what is a dream sequence without
them? Ha!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uh&mdash;yes,&#8221; said Harold a little
uncertainly.</p>
<p>Mildume&#8217;s finger shot out.
&#8220;You fellows understand that I&#8217;m
no dreamy-eyed impractical scientist.
Let&#8217;s face it&mdash;it takes money
to carry on experiments like mine.
Good old-fashioned money. I&#8217;ll
need at least ten thousand dollars.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold raised his eyebrows.
&#8220;Just what, Dr. Mildume, do you
propose to give us for ten
thousand dollars?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Beasts,&#8221; said Mildume. &#8220;<i>Real</i>
monsters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I beg your pardon?&#8221; said
Harold. He began to work out
strategies in his mind. Maybe he
could casually walk over to the
phone and pick it up quickly and
call the studio police. Maybe he
could get the jump on this madman
before he pulled a knife. The
thing to do was to humor him
meanwhile....</p>
<p>Dr. Mildume said, &#8220;I will not
deal with underlings. I demand
to see Mr. Untz himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; said Harold, &#8220;you
understand that Mr. Untz is a
busy man. It&#8217;s my job to check
propositions people have for him.
Suppose you tell me about these
beasts of yours.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mildume shrugged. &#8220;Doubt
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_52' name='page_52'></a>52</span>
if you&#8217;ll understand it any better
than Untz will. But it&#8217;s no more
complicated than television when
you boil it right down. You&#8217;re
familiar, I take it, with the basic
principle of television?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, sure,&#8221; said Harold,
brightening. &#8220;Keep things moving.
Have a master of ceremonies who
keeps jumping in and out of the
act. Give something away to the
audience, if possible, to make
them feel ashamed not to tune
in.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, no, no, <i>no</i>!&#8221; said
Mildume. &#8220;I mean the technical
principles. A photo-electric beam
scans the subject, translates light
and dark into electrical impulses,
which eventually alter a cathode
ray played upon a fluorescent
screen. Hence, the image. You
grasp that roughly, I take it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Roughly,&#8221; said Harold.</p>
<p>&#8220;Well,&#8221; continued Mildume,
&#8220;just as spots of light and dark
are the building blocks of an
image, so sub-atomic particles are
the building blocks of matter.
Once we recognize this the teleportation
theory becomes relatively
simple. There are engineering
difficulties, of course.</p>
<p>&#8220;We must go back to Faraday&#8217;s
three laws of electrolysis&mdash;and
Chadwick&#8217;s establishment in nineteen
thirty-one of the fact that
radiation is merely the movement
of particles of proton mass without
proton charge. Neutrons, you
see. Also that atomic weights are
close integers, when hydrogen is
one point zero zero eight. Thus
I use hydrogen as a basis. Simple,
isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold frowned. &#8220;Wait a
minute. What&#8217;s this you&#8217;re talking
about&mdash;<i>teleportation</i>? You mean
a way of moving matter through
space, just as television moves an
image through space?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, not precisely,&#8221; said
Mildume. &#8220;It&#8217;s more a duplication
of matter. My Mildume beam&mdash;really
another expression of the
quanta or light energy absorbed
by atoms&mdash;scans and analyzes
matter. The wave variations are
retranslated into form, or formulae,
at a distant point&mdash;the
receiving point.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold lowered one eyebrow.
&#8220;And this really works?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mildume.
&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s still crude. It doesn&#8217;t
work all the time. It works only
along vast distances. I won&#8217;t announce
it until I perfect it further.
Meanwhile I need more money to
carry on and when, through
certain relatives, I heard of Mr.
Untz&#8217;s problem&mdash;well, it was
simply too much to resist. You
see, I&#8217;ve managed to teleport a
couple of frightful monsters from
somewhere out of space. I was
wondering what on earth to do
with them.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Where&mdash;where are they?&#8221;
asked Harold.</p>
<p>&#8220;In my back yard,&#8221; said Dr.
Mildume.</p>
<p>At that point Mr. Maximilian
Untz abruptly reappeared. He
smelled of lotion and he was now
dressed in a relatively conservative
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_53' name='page_53'></a>53</span>
gabardine of forest green
with a lavender shirt and a black
knitted tie.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello,&#8221; he said. He looked at
Mildume. &#8220;So who is this?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He says he has monsters for
the dream sequence in his back
yard,&#8221; explained Harold. &#8220;<i>Real</i>
ones.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Mr. Untz, &#8220;kindly
ask the gentleman to get lost,
will you, Harold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, wait,&#8221; Harold said. &#8220;He
may have something. He explained
some of it to me. It
sounds almost possible. We can&#8217;t
lose much by taking a look.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a few thousand dollars a
minute,&#8221; said Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Bah&mdash;money!</i>&#8221; said Dr. Mildume.
&#8220;Which reminds me&mdash;these
monsters of mine are going
to cost you. Let&#8217;s have that
understood, right now.&#8221;</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Mr. Untz&#8217;s</span> eyebrows went up.
This kind of talk he understood.
He reached into the side pocket
of the gabardine for his cigarette
case. He kept a separate gold
case in each suit.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Yeeeeow!</i>&#8221; said Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>His hand came out of the
pocket with a small green snake
in it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Drop it! Stand back!&#8221; said
Harold, being cool.</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it,&#8221; said
Dr. Mildume in a calmer voice.
He was blinking mildly at the
snake. &#8220;It&#8217;s merely an ordinary
species of garden snake, sometimes
erroneously called garter
snake. Curious it should be
there.&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold looked at Dr. Mildume
sharply. &#8220;This teleportation of
yours wouldn&#8217;t have anything to
do with it by any chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course not,&#8221; snapped Mildume.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>I</i> know how it got here!&#8221; said
Mr. Untz, his jowls trembling. He
had already dropped the snake.
&#8220;A certain child star whose initials
are Jimsy LaRoche! Last week he
gives me a hotfoot. Monday a
wet seat&mdash;soaked newspapers in
my chair under one thin dry one.
Yesterday a big frog in my
shower. I should take that brat
over my knee and spank him to
his face!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Mm&mdash;ah&mdash;of course,&#8221; said
Dr. Mildume without much interest
in the topic. &#8220;Shall we go
to inspect the monsters now?&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz thought it over, only
long enough to keep himself
within the time limits of a Man of
Decision. Then he said, &#8220;Okay,
so we&#8217;ll go now.&#8221;</p>
<p>They passed Jimsy LaRoche on
the way out. He was drinking
pineapple juice and sitting with
his tutor, studying his lines. He
smirked as Mr. Untz passed. Mr.
Untz scowled back but didn&#8217;t say
anything. In Jovian silence he
led the way to his car.</p>
<p>It turned out to be a longer
ride than they had expected. Dr.
Mildume lived in Twenty-nine
Palms and, as Mr. Untz explained
it, this was too short for an airplane
and too long for an automobile.
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_54' name='page_54'></a>54</span>
Mr. Untz was not in his
best humor when they stopped
before Dr. Mildume&#8217;s stucco and
tile-roof house.</p>
<p>Mildume directed them immediately
to a walled-in patio in
the rear of the place. A shed-roof
covered one side of the patio
and under it were racks of equipment.
Harold recognized banks
of relays, power amplifiers, oscillographs
and some other familiar
devices. There were also some
strange ones.</p>
<p>Mildume waved his long fingers
at all of it. &#8220;My teleportation
set-up is entirely too bulky so far
for practical use, as you can see.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Nph,&#8221; said Mr. Untz, eyeing
it. During the drive Dr. Mildume
and Harold had explained more
to him about teleportation and
the monsters and he was more
doubtful than ever about the
whole thing. &#8220;So let&#8217;s see the
monsters,&#8221; he said now. &#8220;Time is
fleeing.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mildume went in his hopping
step across the patio to a huge
tarpaulin that covered something
square and bulky. He worried the
tarpaulin away. Two steel cages
stood there.</p>
<p>&#8220;Sacred carp!&#8221; said Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>Two <i>somethings</i> were in the
steel cages.</p>
<p>They were both iridescent
greenish-gray in color, they had
globular bodies, no discernible
heads and eyes on stalks growing
from their bodies. Three eyes
apiece. If they <i>were</i> eyes&mdash;anyway,
they looked like eyes. Sweeping
fibrillae came down to the
ground and seemed to serve as
feet. Great saw-toothed red
gashes in the middle of each body
might have been mouths.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re&mdash;they&#8217;re <i>real</i>. They&#8217;re
<i>alive</i>!&#8221; said Harold Potter hoarsely.
That was the thing about them.
They had the elusive quality of
life about them&mdash;and of course
they were thus infinitely more
terrifying than the prop department&#8217;s
fake monsters.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re alive all right,&#8221; said
Dr. Mildume chattily. &#8220;Took me
quite a bit of experimenting to
discover what to feed them. They
like glass&mdash;broken glass. They&#8217;re
evidently a silicon rather than a
carbon form of life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;This I&#8217;ll buy,&#8221; said Mr. Untz,
still staring.</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course,&#8221; said Mildume. &#8220;I
knew you would. They will cost
you exactly ten thousand dollars
per day. Per twenty-four hour
period.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Profiteer&mdash;burglar!&#8221; said Mr.
Untz, glaring at Mildume.</p>
<p>Mildume shrugged.</p>
<p>There was an abrupt, high-pitched
squeak. Harold stared at
the monsters. The smaller one
was quivering.</p>
<p>&#8220;They do that when they&#8217;re
angry,&#8221; Dr. Mildume said. &#8220;Some
sort of skin vibration. This
smaller one here seems to take
the initiative in things. Must be a
male. Unless there&#8217;s female dominance,
as in birds of prey,
wherever these things come from.
I&#8217;ve&mdash;uh&mdash;been unable to ascertain
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_55' name='page_55'></a>55</span>
which is which, if any.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz frowned suddenly.
&#8220;Look&mdash;just how dangerous are
these things?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t know <i>exactly</i>,&#8221; said Dr.
Mildume. &#8220;A pigeon got too near
the cages the other day. They
seemed to enjoy it. Although, as
I say, their staple appears to be
silicon forms. I carelessly set a
Weston analyzer too near them
the other day and they had it for
lunch.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If they&#8217;re too dangerous ...&#8221;
began Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>&#8220;What if they are?&#8221; said Mildume.
&#8220;You make pictures with
wild lions and tigers and alligators,
don&#8217;t you? Seems to me you can
find a way. I don&#8217;t recommend
letting them out of the cage
however.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz nodded and said,
&#8220;Well, maybe we can get Etienne
Flaubert to do something with
them. He&#8217;s the animal trainer we
call on. Anyway Untz always
figures something out. Only that&#8217;s
why I like musicals better. There
isn&#8217;t so much to figure out and
you can play Victor Herbert
backwards and get new tunes out
of him. So anyway, we&#8217;ll get a
truck and get these monsters to
the studio right away.&#8221;</p>
<p>It was arranged. It was arranged
with utmost secrecy too.
There were other studios, after
all, and in spite of their wealth
of creative talent it was easier to
steal an idea than cook up a new
one. Atom bomb secrecy descended
upon the Crusader Pictures
lot and most especially upon
Sound Stage Six, where the dream
sequence for the psychological
thriller, &#8220;Jolt!&#8221; was being filmed.</p>
<p>Even Jimsy LaRoche, the star
of the picture, was excluded from
the big barn-like stage. Mr. Untz
prepared to get his first stock
shots of the beasts.</p>
<p>There were gasps and much
popping of eyebrows when Dr.
Mildume&mdash;who had come along
as technical adviser&mdash;removed the
tarpaulins from the cages. The
cameramen, the grips, the electricians,
the sound men&mdash;all
stared unbelievingly. The script
girl grabbed Mr. Untz&#8217;s hand and
dug her fingernails into it. The
makeup stylist clutched the lapels
of his mauve jacket and fainted.</p>
<p>&#8220;Nothing to be afraid of,&#8221; Mr.
Untz said to everybody. He was
sort of convincing himself too.
&#8220;Dr. Mildume here knows all
about the monsters. He&#8217;s got
everything under control. So tell
everybody about them, Doctor.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mildume nodded, bobbing his
short white beard. He thrust his
hands into his tweed jacket,
looked all around for a moment,
then said, &#8220;I don&#8217;t know exactly
where the monsters are from. I
had my Q-beam pointed into
space, and I was focussing it, intending
to put it on Mars at the
time of proper conjunction. All
very complicated. However the
beam must have worked prematurely.
These monsters began to
form in the hydrogen chamber.&#8221;</p>
<p>Several of the listeners looked
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_56' name='page_56'></a>56</span>
at other listeners with unmistakable
doubt. Unruffled, Dr. Mildume
went on, &#8220;Now, we can
make certain rough assumptions
from the form and structure of
these monsters. You will notice
that except for their appendages
they are globularly formed. Any
engineer can tell you that the
arch and hemisphere sustain the
greatest weight for their mass.</p>
<p>&#8220;We may concede that they
come from a planet of very strong
gravity. Their skin, for instance,
is tough and rigid compared with
ours. They have difficulty staying
rooted to earth&mdash;often a simple
multipod movement will send
them bouncing to the top of the
cage. There is one other factor&mdash;the
smaller of these creatures
seems the more dominant&mdash;suggesting
that on their home planet
smaller beings are more agile and
therefore better able to take care
of themselves.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There, you see?&#8221; interrupted
Mr. Untz, slipping into a pause.
&#8220;That&#8217;s all there is to it. So now
let us please get down to business.&#8221;</p>
<p>So they got down to business.
And it was not easy business,
photographing these monsters.
Keeping the cage wires out of
focus required a critical distance
for each lens but whenever a
camera came too near a fibrilla
would shoot forward&mdash;at the
glass, no doubt&mdash;and scare the
wits out of the cameramen.</p>
<p>The shorter lenses got too much
of the surrounding area into the
picture. The crew tried and tried.
One technician muttered darkly
that the organization contract
didn&#8217;t cover this sort of thing. Mr.
Untz pleaded and cajoled and
heckled and moved about and
tried to keep things going. Somehow,
anyhow.</p>
<p>Eddie Tamoto, the chief
cameraman, finally came up to
him and said, &#8220;It&#8217;s no use, Max.
These cages simply don&#8217;t allow
us to do anything. Why don&#8217;t we
put them in the cages they use for
jungle pictures? They&#8217;re big and
camouflaged, and the mesh size
is right.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;So maybe we&#8217;ll have to do
that,&#8221; said Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>Dr. Mildume dipped his head.
&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I&#8217;d like to see
these other cages first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Mr. Untz. &#8220;Don&#8217;t
worry about it. If they hold lions
they will hold your whatever-you-call-thems.
I&#8217;ll get the animal
trainer, Flaubert, to stand by. He
practically talks to animals&mdash;except
horses, which is his hard
luck.&#8221;</p>
<p>The jungle cages were duly
summoned and so was Etienne
Flaubert of the Golden West
Animal Education Studios on
Sunset Boulevard. While they
waited Mr. Untz stood aside with
Harold Potter. He mopped his
brow&mdash;he gestured at the whole
group. &#8220;This,&#8221; he said, &#8220;is the
story of my life.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It is?&#8221; asked Harold.</p>
<p>Mr. Untz nodded. &#8220;Me, I am
an expert on musicals. Musicals
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_57' name='page_57'></a>57</span>
I can do with my left hand. But
ever since I am in Hollywood I
do everything <i>but</i> a musical. And
always something gets fouled up.
Always there is trouble. You will
not believe this, Harold, but I am
an unhappy man.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I believe it,&#8221; said Harold.</p>
<p>Mr. Untz looked at him sharply
and said, &#8220;You don&#8217;t have to
believe it so quickly. You could
give me a chance to explain.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look,&#8221; said Harold&mdash;now
being truly interested and forgetting
some of the first principles
of buttering-up one&#8217;s boss, &#8220;take
the scientific attitude. Everything
is <i>relative</i>.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said Mr. Untz, &#8220;In
Hollywood everything is relatives,
believe me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no&mdash;I wasn&#8217;t referring to
nepotism,&#8221; said Harold. &#8220;I was
thinking that you and many
others, of course, prefer musicals.
But there are vast other groups
who prefer westerns, detectives,
comedies or what have you. One
man&#8217;s meat is another&#8217;s poison.</p>
<p>&#8220;But nourishment stays the
same in principle. The artistic
demands still hold and a good
picture is a picture, whatever its
field. Now, if you, as a producer,
can shift to the other fellow&#8217;s
viewpoint&mdash;find out why the thing
that terrifies you amuses him&mdash;or
vice versa.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; said Mr. Untz, not
without suspicion, &#8220;are you an
assistant producer or a philosopher?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sometimes to be the one,&#8221;
sighed Harold, &#8220;you have to be
the other.&#8221;</p>
<p>The big jungle cage arrived
presently. While it was being set
up another assistant came to Mr.
Untz and said, &#8220;Jimsy LaRoche
is outside, yelling to get in, Mr.
Untz.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz whirled on the assistant
and said, &#8220;Tell that overpaid
brat&mdash;who I personally didn&#8217;t
want in my picture in the first
place&mdash;tell him in the second
place the President of the United
States could not get in here this
afternoon. No, wait a minute,
that wouldn&#8217;t mean anything to
him&mdash;he makes more money than
the President. Just tell him no.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, sir,&#8221; said the assistant.
He left.</p>
<p>About then the animal trainer,
Etienne Flaubert, was admitted.
He walked right up to Mr. Untz.
Flaubert was nearly seven feet
tall. He had tremendous shoulders
and none of it was coat padding.
He had a chest one might have
gone over Niagara Falls in. He
had a huge golden beard. When
he spoke it sounded like the bass
viol section of the Los Angeles
Symphony tuning up.</p>
<p>He said to Mr. Untz, &#8220;Where
are these monsters I hear about?
I&#8217;d like to see the monster that
isn&#8217;t just a big kitty, like all the
rest. Big kitties, that&#8217;s all they
are. You gotta know how to
handle them.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz led Flaubert to the
cage and said, &#8220;There.&#8221;</p>
<p>Flaubert gasped. Then he
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_58' name='page_58'></a>58</span>
steadied himself. The monsters
had been maneuvered into the
bigger cage by now&mdash;Dr. Mildume
had enticed them with broken
electric light bulbs and slammed
the drop-doors behind them by a
remote-control rope. They had
finished their meal of glass. They
were curled in a corner of the
cage now, tentacles wrapped about
each other, squeaking contentedly.</p>
<p>Flaubert recovered a bit.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kitties, just big kitties,&#8221; he
growled.</p>
<p>Eddie Tamoto called, &#8220;Hey,
Max, we&#8217;d like to get &#8217;em in the
center of the cage for a shot.&#8221; He
was gesturing from the camera
boom seat. &#8220;Only moving around.
You know&mdash;looking fierce.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can you do it, Flaubert?&#8221;
said Mr. Untz, turning to the big
trainer.</p>
<p>&#8220;Just big kitties,&#8221; said Flaubert.</p>
<p>He had brought his own whip
and blank cartridge pistol. His
assistant stood by with a .30-30
rifle. Dr. Mildume opened the
door quickly and Flaubert slipped
into the cage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay&mdash;get set, everybody!&#8221;
yelled Mr. Untz. People scurried.
An attendant switched on the
warning light and rocker arm that
warned people outside of the
stage not to barge in. &#8220;Quiet!&#8221;
yelled Mr. Untz. &#8220;Quiet&mdash;<i>quiet</i>!&#8221;
yelled several assistants. The
order went down the line. Through
channels.</p>
<p>And there stood Etienne Flaubert,
huge and more or less unafraid,
in the middle of the cage.
The monsters in the corner began
slowly to uncoil their tentacles
from about each other. Their eye-stalks
rose and began to wave
slowly. Their red saw-toothed
mouths worked into pouts, gapes
and grins.</p>
<p>The smaller of the two suddenly
shuddered all over. Its angry
chirping noise shrilled through
the sound stage. Its tough skin
vibrated&mdash;blurred. It sprang suddenly
to its multipods and charged
Flaubert.</p>
<p>Flaubert screamed an unholy
scream. He threw the chair and
the whip and the gun at the
monster and dove from the exit.
Dr. Mildume opened the cage
door with his rope and Flaubert
went through it&mdash;himself a blur.
The monster, in his wake, slammed
into the door and stayed
there, trembling, still chirping its
rage.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hully gee, what kitties!&#8221; said
Flaubert, pale and sweating.</p>
<p>Mr. Untz groaned.</p>
<p>&#8220;I got some of it!&#8221; yelled Eddie
Tamoto from his camera. &#8220;It was
terrific! But we need more!&#8221;</p>
<p>Then&mdash;simultaneously&mdash;there
were several loud screams of
alarm. Mr. Untz looked at the
cage again. The smaller monster
had found a crack, and was
moving the cage door and squeezing
through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold!&#8221; shouted Mr. Untz.
&#8220;<i>Do something!</i>&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold stepped forward. &#8220;Back
everybody,&#8221; he said in his best
<span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_59' name='page_59'></a>59</span>
calm voice. &#8220;Walk&mdash;do not run&mdash;to
the nearest exit.&#8221;</p>
<p>The second monster was already
vibrating across the cage
and the smaller one was holding
the door open for it. Dr. Mildume
had tried to maneuver the control
ropes to close the door again,
but hadn&#8217;t been able to work
them&mdash;and now he had left his
post.</p>
<p>Harold pointed to the man with
the rifle and said, &#8220;Fire!&#8221;</p>
<p>The rifleman fired.</p>
<p>Nothing&mdash;nothing at all happened.
He fired several times
more. The monsters didn&#8217;t even
jerk when the bullets hit them.</p>
<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re&mdash;they&#8217;re impervious
yet!&#8221; cried Mr. Untz.</p>
<p>After that it was every man for
himself.</p>
<p>Moments later Harold found
himself outside of the sound stage
and on the studio street, bunched
with the others and staring at the
thick closed door. Nobody spoke.
Everybody just thrummed silently
with the knowledge that two alien
monsters were in there, wreaking
heaven knew what damage....</p>
<p>And then, as they stared, the
thick door began to open again.
&#8220;It isn&#8217;t locked!&#8221; breathed Mr.
Untz. &#8220;Nobody remembered to
lock it again!&#8221;</p>
<p>A tentacle peeked out of the
crack of the door.</p>
<p>Everybody scattered a second
time.</p>
<p>Harold never remembered the
order in which things happened
amidst the confusion that followed.
It seemed he and Mr.
Untz ran blindly, side by side,
down the studio street for awhile.
It seemed all kinds of people were
also running, in all kinds of directions.</p>
<p>Bells were ringing&mdash;sirens blew&mdash;a
blue studio police car took a
corner on two wheels and barely
missed them. Harold had a
glimpse of uniformed men with
drawn pistols.</p>
<p>They ended up somehow at Mr.
Untz&#8217;s office-cottage. They went
inside and Mr. Untz locked the
door and slammed his back to it.
He leaned there, panting. He said,
&#8220;Trouble, trouble, trouble. I
should have stayed in Vienna.
And in Vienna I should have
stood in bed.&#8221;</p>
<p>The door of the shower and
dressing-room opened and Jimsy
LaRoche came out. He had a
number of snails in his out-stretched
hand and he coolly kept
them there, making no attempt to
conceal his obvious purpose in the
shower. He looked directly at Mr.
Untz with his dark disconcerting
eleven-year-old eyes and said,
&#8220;Well, Max, what goof-off did
you pull this time?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>You!</i>&#8221; roared Mr. Untz, whirling
and shooting a finger at the
child star. A focusing point for
all his troubles, at last. His jowls
shook. &#8220;You, Jimsy LaRoche,&#8221;
he said, &#8220;are going to get your
first old fashioned spanking on
the bottom! From me, personally!&#8221;
He advanced toward the
boy, who backed away hastily.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_60' name='page_60'></a>60</span></div>
<p>Jimsy began to look a little
frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;Now wait a minute, Max,&#8221;
said Harold, stepping forward.
&#8220;We&#8217;ve got enough <i>big</i> monsters
to think about without worrying
about this <i>little</i> monster too.&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz stared at Harold
queerly. Suddenly he said, &#8220;Why
didn&#8217;t I think of it before?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Think of what?&#8221; asked Harold.</p>
<p>But Mr. Untz had already
grabbed Jimsy LaRoche&#8217;s hand
and dragged him through the
door.</p>
<p>There were several reasons why
Harold Potter did not immediately
pursue. For one thing he stood
there for several moments stupified
with surprise. Then, when
he did recover, he plunged forward
and promptly tripped on the
cream-colored carpet and fell flat
on his face. He tripped again
going over the step to the cottage
door. He bumped into a studio
policeman rounding the next corner.
He snagged his coat on a
fence picket going around the
corner after that. But he kept
Mr. Untz and the dragged youngster
in sight.</p>
<p>Eventually he came to the door
of Sound Stage Six.</p>
<p>Speaking from a police standpoint
all laymen had disappeared.
A ring of studio police and firemen,
along with some policemen
and detectives from the outside,
had been drawn around the
monsters and everybody and his
brother was shooting off pistols
and rifles at them. With no result,
of course. Nor did anyone
dare get too close.</p>
<p>Harold caught up with Mr.
Untz about the time a man he
recognized as a reporter did. The
reporter was stout, freckled and
bespectacled.</p>
<p>&#8220;<i>Untz!</i>&#8221; barked the reporter,
with all the power of the press in
his voice, &#8220;do you realize this is
a national danger? If those
monsters can&#8217;t be stopped by
bullets, what will stop them?
Where will it all end? Where did
they come from?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Look in tomorrow&#8217;s paper!&#8221;
growled Mr. Untz, brushing the
reporter aside. He kept Jimsy&#8217;s
arm in a firm grip. Jimsy was
bawling at the top of his lungs
now. Mr. Untz breasted the
police cordon, broke through.</p>
<p>&#8220;Max! <i>Stop!</i>&#8221; shouted Harold.
&#8220;Max&mdash;have you gone mad?&#8221;</p>
<p>Max evidently had. He moved
so swiftly that everyone was too
surprised to stop him. He burst
into the small human-walled
arena where the two bewildered
monsters squatted and he thrust
little Jimsy LaRoche out before
him&mdash;right at the monsters.</p>
<p>An extraordinary thing happened.
The monsters suddenly
began to quiver and squeak again
but this time&mdash;it was clear to the
ear somehow&mdash;not with rage, but
with <i>fear</i>. Pure and terrible fear.
They trained their eye-stalks on
Jimsy LaRoche, they paled to a
lighter shade of brown and green,
then slowly they began to back
away.</p>
<div><span class='pagenum pncolor'><a id='page_61' name='page_61'></a>61</span></div>
<p>&#8220;Hold your fire, men!&#8221; called
a police captain, probably just to
get into the act.</p>
<p>Dr. Mildume appeared again
from somewhere. So did Etienne
Flaubert. So did Eddie Tamoto
and some of the other technicians.
They gaped and stared.</p>
<p>Slowly, inexorably, using Jimsy
LaRoche as his threat, Mr. Untz
backed the two monsters into the
studio, and gradually to the cage.
Dr. Mildume leaped forward to
shut them in once more.</p>
<p>And through it all Jimsy LaRoche
continued to bawl at the
top of his lungs.</p>
<hr class='invis' />
<p class='dropcap'><span class='dcap'>Later</span>, in Mr. Untz&#8217;s office-cottage,
Harold read the newspaper
accounts. He read every word
while Mr. Untz was in the other
room taking a shower. He had to
admit that Max had even thrown
a little credit his way. &#8220;My assistant,
Mr. Potter,&#8221; Untz was
quoted as saying, &#8220;indirectly gave
me the idea when he said that
one man&#8217;s meat was another
man&#8217;s poison.</p>
<p>&#8220;Dr. Mildume had already explained
that the monsters came
from a high-gravity planet&mdash;that
the smaller of the species evidently
seemed the more capable,
and therefore the dominant one.&#8221;
Harold was sure now that the
statement had been polished up a
bit by the publicity department.</p>
<p>&#8220;The only logical assumption,
then,&#8221; the statement continued,
&#8220;was that small stature would
dominate these life forms, rather
than large stature, as in the environment
we know. They were,
in other words, terrified by tiny
Jimsy LaRoche&mdash;whose latest
picture, &#8216;The Atomic Fissionist
and the Waif,&#8217; is now at your
local theatre, by the way&mdash;as an
Earth-being might have been terrified
by a giant!&#8221;</p>
<p>Mr. Untz came out of the
shower at that point. He was
radiant in a canary-colored rayon
sharkskin. He was rubbing his
hands. He was beaming.</p>
<p>&#8220;Harold,&#8221; he said, &#8220;they&#8217;re
putting me on a musical next. I
got them twined around my little
finger. Life is good. I think that
screwy Dr. Mildume was smart
to send those things back out into
space before they could get to
him. Otherwise we might have
<i>had</i> to put them in pictures and
with contracts yet.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Max,&#8221; said Harold, staring at
him quietly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, Harold?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Just answer me one thing
truthfully. I swear I&#8217;ll never repeat
it&mdash;or even blame you. But
for my own curiosity I&#8217;ve got to
know.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Why certainly, Harold, what
is it?&#8221;</p>
<p>Harold Potter swallowed hard.
&#8220;Did you,&#8221; he asked, &#8220;<i>really</i>
figure out that Jimsy would scare
the beasts&mdash;or were you about to
<i>throw</i> the little brat to them?&#8221;</p>
